1. What's React?
- What was like when we didn't have React?
+ Before it, I was writing jQuery to work with Dom. It's was integrated into the HTML code so we call it a library.
If 1 single HTML tag is 1 DOM? ...
so jQuery actually did manupuliate the HTML so the HTML is rendered first then we can work with its code.
+ With React, we control the logic, data (it's like back-end in the front-end at first) (business domain, ...) -> generate JSX (in render function) -> compile HTML code
so React is like a back-end framework that works on the actual front-end. API is a protocol or gateway to communicate with Database. Maybe not, there might be a risk to handle business logic on front-end.
