// I'm writing this from my parents house after years of doing some unproductive for my tech career in terms of finance and time aspects. Now I created this repo to document my job/tech carreers as serious as it is.
// AI is taking over the news and Mark is about to manufactor the Quest in VN so all my writing in this repo is my knowing from the world (not AI-generated) so it's gonna be raw as new-borns.
// I need to get back to live my life as a developer/engineer not an businessman. I know some business people, I met thousands of customers and I started acting like a saleman or customer support person, that doesn't help me here. It's not productive for the mind.

// I'm about to get a React developer job because that's the quickest way to move out right now. I won't mind if my hands are hurt anymore. Now the brain is more important, it's harder to fix. So I enjoys more the async issue solving of Github and the Git. It's the best way to work with different people. I did a help for my family sister to help her decorate her house, it's not a lot of works but it turned out a not-funny experience of working. I like working with funny people doing serious works.

// I need to eat this Pho(Phá»Ÿ) from yesterday.

// It's a writing and also a JS file. I want every pieces of code about a knowledege domain is a part of something bigger. I want to go from the low-level knowledge to the front-end of the end users.
// Or I could go from new-borns level to senior level. As people scroll from the top of the page to the bottom, they gonna go through a journey about 55 minutes then 5 minutes break.
// Let's break down Threads
