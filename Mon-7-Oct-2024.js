// I'm writing this from my parents house after years of doing some unproductive for my tech career in terms of finance and time aspects. Now I created this repo to document my job/tech carreers as serious as it is.
// AI is taking over the news and Mark is about to manufactor the Quest in VN so all my writing in this repo is my knowing from the world (not AI-generated) so it's gonna be raw as new-borns.
// I need to get back to live my life as a developer/engineer not an businessman. I know some business people, I met thousands of customers and I started acting like a saleman or customer support person, that doesn't help me here. It's not productive for the mind.

I did a help for my family sister to help her decorate her house, it's not a lot of works but it turned out a not-funny experience of working. I like working with funny people doing serious works.

// ** I need to render an image in this JS file:
// 1. this JS is client or server? it's impossible to render on client?
// 2. What if I upload this image to another server and use their API? 
// free: Imgur? Github server 2G per file.
// 3. Do we optimize for this image uploading here? As I documented the history here, it might be a lot.
// 4. SEO?
